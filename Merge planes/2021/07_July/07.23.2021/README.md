# Merge Plane session July 23rd 2021

I had a short session today and did a little bit of merging. I made it extremely close to a level 43 plane today. The games leaderboard is broken, but I still enjoy the game. I made small progress today, and played a lot less than last week. I only need to get 1 more level 38 or higher plane, and I will be able to merge and get a level 43 plane. I am only 0.6% away from reaching this goal. - July 16th 2021

I made significant progress today, and played for a long time. I was extremely close to getting a level 44 plane, but I needed additional money to make it to the next plane level. - July 23rd 2021
