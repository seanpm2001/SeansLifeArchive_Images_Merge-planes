# Merge Plane session June 11th 2021

I had a short session today and did slightly less/more merging than last time. The games leaderboard finally broke 5 sessions ago, I knew it would at some point. It is completely broken now. The game is less fun now, as there are hardly any objectives left, so I briefly played just to collect and make some progresss.

## Overview

See above.
