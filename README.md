# SeansLifeArchive_Images_Merge-planes
The module for my life story project that contains my Merge Plane gameplay images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all mt daily/weekly Merge Plane session pictures. I currently play the [Android version (404)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=404) I never played the iOS version, as I started playing this game later than 2015 (starting in 2018)

These daily pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images. You can learn more about Merge Plane by [clicking/tapping here (the game doesn't have a Wikipedia page)](https://www.crazygames.com/game/merge-plane). You can download an APK through APKPure if you are fine with dealing with hCaptcha [APKPure link](https://apkpure.com/merge-plane-click-idle-tycoon/com.brokenreality.planemerger.android)
